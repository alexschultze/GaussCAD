A simulator for evaluating Gaussian optics and simulate projection onto
a photodiode. Visual representation of intensity/phase 
fields as described by Gaussian optics.

Features:
-Symmetrical Gaussian Beams of TEM00 mode
-Calculation of interference on a SED/QPD photodiode detector.
-Determination of Contrast (AC,DC), phase angle and DWS on detector.
-Detector shape (round, gap, per quadrant evaluation) supported.
-Propagation according to Matrix Optics (Paraxial approximation) of Gauss beam

It does not feature:
-Modes besides TEM00
-Raytracing
-Polarisation

Tested with Matlab v2018b.
